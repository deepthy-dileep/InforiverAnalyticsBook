# Working with Analytics+

The Analytics+ visual has been built as a storytelling platform that enables even casual users to create engaging, dynamic dashboards and reports in a matter of minutes. Let's embark on our data visualization journey and learn how to leverage the capabilities provided by Analytics+!

To follow along with this tutorial, you can download and use the datasets in this pbix file. Feel free to use your datasets as well!&#x20;

### 1. Add the visual

First, we need to add the Inforiver Analytics+ visual to the Power BI canvas. Use the links in the visual for additional information:

* **Getting started**: Watch the video to get an overview of how Analytics+ works.
* **Demo**: This link navigates to the interactive demo page where you can explore the different types of dashboards and charts that can be created with Analytics+.
* **Documentation**: Discover all the advanced reporting, visualization and customization capabilities available in Analytics+.
* **Pricing**: Analytics+ offers different pricing tiers and plans you can use to purchase.

### 2. Choose the mode

The Analytics+ visual ships with 3 different modes, each with a dedicated toolbar that contains customization options specific to a particular mode. You can seamlessly switch between the three modes by navigating to the respective ribbon. Click on each of the tabs below to preview the modes.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Chart" %}
A range of diverse charts including Waterfall, Marimekko, Bullet charts, and boxplots. The Analytics+ library has suitable charts for every data visualization use case.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Card" %}
KPI cards with embedded charts, text and image support to showcase your metrics.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Table" %}
A bird's eye view of your data categories and relationships with the classic Small multiples table.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Gantt" %}
Visualize task schedules, identify dependencies, allocate resources, and track deadlines with the Analytics+ Gantt chart.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Storyboard" %}
Rapidly design captivating dashboards with a single visual and a single query. Effortlessly incorporate charts, text, images, slicers, KPI cards, and tables without the need to import separate visuals for each element type.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### 3. Enable IBCS

Analytics+ is an IBCS-certified visual. Enable the **IBCS standards** toggle to create charts, KPI cards, and tables that are fully IBCS compliant.

Since we chose the chart mode, an IBCS compliant chart is rendered.

### 4. Enable performance mode

Line and area charts with high data volume and a large number of data points can be plotted significantly faster with the performance mode option.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1957).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Performance mode</p></figcaption></figure>

When you enable performance mode, you'll notice that the performance mode toggle in the toolbar is automatically enabled and a line chart is rendered by default.

### 5. Assign data

For starters, let's assign one dimension and one measure to the visual parameters. By default, the chart mode is selected and Inforiver renders a bar chart.

### 6. Customize your report

Inforiver provides the flexibility to customize every element of your report. The best part is that tailoring your visual is truly at your fingertips - you don't need to enable the toolbar and open the visual in focus mode.&#x20;

* You can use the **+** icon at the bottom left of the visual to open the context menu.  From here, you can apply several modifications such as changing the chart type, enabling elements like KPIs or data labels, or choosing a different layout.
* You can simply click on any element that you want to customize and use Inforiver's handy on-object interaction menus to access the wide range of options.

In the upcoming sections, we'll learn how to build interactive dashboards like this one and take a deep dive into each of the modes supported in Analytics+.
