# Advanced sorting

The Advanced Sorting option provides the capability to sort your data on different columns simultaneously i.e. perform a nested sort. Click on the Advanced button in the sorting interface to open the Advanced sorting window.

{% hint style="info" %}
Advanced sorting takes precedence over basic sorting. For instance, if you have sorted the data by the variance and then applied advanced sorting on a dimension category, the basic sort will be overridden.
{% endhint %}

## 1. Advanced sorting for charts

We can use the advanced sorting option to apply a nested sort on Subcategory in ascending order and Region in descending order.

## 2. Advanced sorting for cards

You can apply nested sorting in the trellis mode as well. The group dimension can also be used as a sorting factor i.e. you can sort the panels. In this example, we have:

* sorted the panels in descending order (based on Month)
* sorted the bars in each chart in ascending order (based on Actuals)

## 3. Advanced sorting for tables

In table mode, you can perform an Excel-like nested sort. We've sorted based on the axis values.
