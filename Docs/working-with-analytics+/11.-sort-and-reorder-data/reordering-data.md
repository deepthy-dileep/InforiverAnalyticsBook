# Reordering data

You can re-order the data in your charts, trellis panels, or tables. Refer to the [summary tables ](../16.-summary-tables.md)section to re-order data for charts and cards.

### 1. Reordering data for tables

You can click on a row category (axis value) and drag it to re-oder rows. Note that the sorting method is set to 'Custom sort' when data is manually re-ordered.
