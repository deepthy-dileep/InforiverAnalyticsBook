# 1. Navigating the Analytics+ toolbar

Analytics+ is a one-stop shop for dashboards and storyboards, offering charts, cards, and tables in a single visual platform. A key aspect of Analytics+ is that it is highly customizable. You can tailor the report to the specific needs of the audience.&#x20;

First things first - to enable the toolbar, after assigning data, hover over the top portion of the visual and click on the arrow icon.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;The toolbar will automatically be displayed if you resize the visual to fill the canvas.
{% endhint %}

The fully loaded toolbar comes with a dedicated ribbon for charts, cards, tables, Gantt charts and the storyboard. We'll take a detailed look at the various moving parts of the Inforiver toolbar and how to navigate the different sections.&#x20;

#### **Summary table**

The summary table shows a tabular view of the underlying data in a chart or card. You can add calculated rows and re-order data in the summary table, the changes are instantly reflected in your visual without having to change the dataset. [Learn more about the summary table](../16.-summary-tables.md).

#### **Performance mode**

Charts with high data volume and density can be plotted significantly faster with the performance mode option. Enable the toggle from the toolbar for faster rendering. Please bear in mind that performance mode is supported for select charts.

{% hint style="info" %}
* TopN ranking will be turned off in performance mode.
* Sorting will be set to native sort.
* Scrollbar will be disabled.
* Multi charts(different charts in each trellis panel) will be reset to uniform charts in all panels.
{% endhint %}
