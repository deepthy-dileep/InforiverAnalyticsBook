# Working with Groups

While you are in the process of designing your KPI dashboard, combining related elements into a group makes it convenient to re-arrange them in the canvas.&#x20;

**Creating a group:** In the KPI section of the toolbar, navigate to Layer > Customize Layers. Select the elements to be combined and click the Group radio button.

You can use the Position and Size options in Group settings to place the group in the canvas and adjust the size.&#x20;

Notice how you can easily drag to reposition and resize elements after creating a group. When you resize a group, the individual elements are proportionally resized.&#x20;
