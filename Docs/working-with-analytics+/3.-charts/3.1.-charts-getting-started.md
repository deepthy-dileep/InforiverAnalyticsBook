# 3.1. Charts - getting started

Charts condense complex datasets into easy-to-understand visual representations, making it simpler for users to grasp key patterns and insights at a glance. They enable comparisons between different datasets, categories, or time periods, facilitating the identification of trends. Charts help tell a story with data by highlighting significant points, and trends.  Without further ado, let's start building with Analytics+!&#x20;

1. Let's add the Analytics+ visual and add some dimensions and measures. Chart mode is the default setting. We'll assign the Axis and Values parameters to render a bar chart. On adding the axis and values fields, Inforiver will dynamically render the chart that is best suited for visualizing the input data.

2. Now that we have added two measures, we can compare the Actuals and the Plan. You would have noticed the Pivot Data window that opened while adding measures. To compare measures, simply drag the Plan measure into the Comparison 1 bucket. An Integrated Variance Column chart has been rendered to highlight the variance between the measures that are being compared.

3. Analytics+ offers you the ability to add more context to your visualizations and get a multi-dimensional perspective of your dataset. We'll see this in action by adding a small multiple parameter and voila you have a single-dimensional trellis!

4. We'll add one more dimension to the small multiples parameter. The manage category window opens and the parameters are automatically mapped to rows and columns.

5. Analytics+ has been designed for extensive support for hierarchical datasets. We'll demonstrate this by adding hierarchical dimensions.

There we have it - a hierarchical trellis that can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the arrow icons near each parent category.

6. We can add related data from multiple measures without plotting them using the Tooltips/Measures parameter. These measures will not be drawn in the visuals but will be used for calculations. The values will be displayed as a tooltip on hovering over any point in the chart.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can see tooltips and perform data selections only in reading view mode. Click on the eye icon at the bottom left corner to switch to reading view.
{% endhint %}

7. Click on any data point to select it. Notice how the selection has been reflected across all the panels in the trellis. [Click here to learn more about data selection](../14.-data-selection.md).

Click on the pencil icon to switch back to edit view.

8. With Analytics+, you can add a dimension to the legend as well. Let's see how this works by adding one more small multiples parameter.

With Analytics+, we've created a hierarchical, multi-dimensional trellis in just a few clicks!
