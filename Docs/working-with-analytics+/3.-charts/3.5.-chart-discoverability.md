# 3.5. Chart discoverability

Inforiver supports diverse data visualization use cases for both advanced visualization types as well as storytelling. Many of the chart types are not typically available out of the box in other tools.&#x20;

Some business users may find it difficult to find a specific type of chart from the vast library of chart types. To make charts more discoverable, Analytics+ has a built-in search capability. You can search for a chart based on the chart name, based on a tag, or based on a specific visualization scenario.&#x20;

### 1. Browse charts based on family

Analytics+ comes packaged with an unprecedented range of chart types - suitable for every business scenario, be it trend identification, storytelling, communication, or comparative analysis. You can browse the various chart types based on the family they belong to.

### 2. Name-based search&#x20;

When you already know what type of chart you are looking for, you can directly type in the name and search for that chart. For example, type in line, waterfall, boxplot, mekko, etc., and all the variations of that chart will be displayed. The naming conventions for chart types can vary across tools. For instance, the Marimekko chart may also be called a variable width in Tableau. Waterfall charts may also be called Cascade charts by Mekkographics or a few other BI tools. Analytics+ will still be able to locate the chart for you however you for search it.

### 3. Tag-based search&#x20;

For those who do not know what type of chart to use, you can perform a keyword or a tag-based search that will display the chart types that are best suited for your requirements. Searching for ‘finance’ will display charts related to financial use cases and entering ‘variance’ will display all charts that can illustrate variances. A few other examples of tag-based search are shown below.

### 4. **Scenario-based chart selection**&#x20;

You can use scenario-based chart selection from the Scenarios tab. Analytics+ can render the chart that is best suited to visualize your data based on your business use case – all you need to do is choose an option from the list of scenarios. For instance, if you need to analyze cash flows across different sectors, you can choose the ‘Financial Breakdown’ scenario, and it will assign your data to a relevant chart type.

### 5. **Chart wizard: simplified chart selection and configuration**

Looking for the right chart? The Chart Wizard is your all-in-one solution! It helps you find the right chart, configure display properties, and set ranking, sorting in one seamless onboarding screen.

Select the Build Chart option from the landing page or navigate to the Chart Type dropdown and select the last tab to open the Chart wizard.

**Selection based on chart family**

If you're familiar with different chart types and their use cases, use the Select Chart option to search by family. You can add your go-to chart types to the Favorites section for quick access.

Once you've selected a chart, you can toggle chart elements (KPIs, axes, data labels, deviation, etc) on or off. You can also adjust the theme, font, color, and fill style—all without navigating through separate settings.

**Selection based on function**

For more advanced recommendations, choose Function. This option helps you narrow down chart types based on the axis data (time series or categorical), use case (comparison, deviation, multivariate), visualization type (bars, points, lines) and number of measures.

Set up analytics, sorting, and ranking all at once from the advanced tab, without needing to configure each individually.
