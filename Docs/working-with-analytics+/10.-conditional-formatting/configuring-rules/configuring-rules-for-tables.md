## 1. Configuring conditional formatting rules

Inforiver provides the options outlined below to configure conditional formatting rules.

**i) Title:** Custom name to uniquely identify the rule.

**ii) Apply to:** The column on which conditional formatting is to be applied.

**iii) Exclude:** Uncheck the 'Total' checkbox if you do not want to apply conditional formatting on the totals row.

**iv) Format by**: To drive conditional formatting based on rules, classification, or color scales,  select the respective option.

**v) Color impacts on:** You can choose the element (like font or background) to which the formatting will be applied.

**vi) Condition:** Define conditions to drive the conditional formatting.

**vii) Add condition:** Use this link to add additional And/or conditions.

Let's look at some applications of conditional formatting in tables.

In the example, we've highlighted the **cell background** in green where the AC is less than PY.

You can emphasize your tabular data with borders and colors. In this scenario, we've applied a **border** when the plan exceeds actuals.

You can categorize your data with the **Format by - Classification** option. Classification allows you to group data into distinct categories (e.g., high, medium, low) and apply different formats to each group. This makes it easier to spot trends, patterns, or outliers at a glance, improving the overall readability of your data.

You can also display classifications as a separate column.

**Action dots** help users quickly gauge the magnitude of the measure and spot deviations. Choose the Format by > Classification option to use action dots in your tables.
