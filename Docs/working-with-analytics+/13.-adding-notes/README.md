# 13. Adding notes

Analytics+ delivers an out-of-the-box and user-friendly annotation feature that allows you to add more perspective to your data. You can add different types of annotations with Analytics+:

* Canvas annotations capture priorities and perspectives for the entire report page.
* Data point annotations capture the context for a specific data point. In tables, cell-level notes enable adding data point annotations to record additional details for every cell.
* Row-level notes in tables allow you to add a notes column to include information applicable to the entire row.
* Footnotes in tables: IBCS recommends the display of footnotes in reports. You can present all the cell-level notes in a single footnote section.

{% hint style="info" %}
The annotation feature can be used only in chart and table mode.
{% endhint %}
