# 6.1. Tables - getting started

We've already talked about Inforiver's powerful data table. In this section, we'll get down to business and build a responsive, intuitive data table in under a few minutes. Let's begin by switching to table mode and adding dimensions and measures.

1. Analytics+ automatically adds measures to the comparison data wells based on the order of the measures: the first measure parameter is assigned to Actuals(AC), the second is assigned to Prior period (PY), the third is assigned to Plan (PL), the fourth is assigned to Forecast (FC) and subsequent measures are assigned to the AC bucket. You can drag and reorder the measures as required in the pivot data window.

2. Analytics+ applies TopN ranking and displays only the top 4 categories- let's display all the product categories in our report.

3. Inforiver enables you to change the look and feel of your reports using a range of built-in themes. We'll switch to the xViz theme.

4\. Now comes the part that we have been waiting for - the small multiples table. All you need to do is add a dimension to the Small Multiples parameter and voila - you have a trellis!

5\. You can visualize your tabular data by embedding charts. We can insert an inline lollipop chart just by selecting the measure and choosing the chart.

6. Not just charts - you can add KPI metrics for data tables as well. Just click on the KPI icon to display the KPIs for each panel.

In the next sections, we'll take a detailed look at all the configuration and analytics options provided by Inforiver.
