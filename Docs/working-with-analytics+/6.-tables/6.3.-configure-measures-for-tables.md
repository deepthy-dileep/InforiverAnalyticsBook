# 6.3. Configure measures for tables

With Analytics+, measure management can be completely driven from within the visual. The report creator only needs to add the required measures as visual parameters - end users can disable measures, set up comparisons, or search for measures.&#x20;

Let's discover the range of measure configurations in Analytics+ and explore how to tailor them to your specific reporting requirements.

#### 1. Actuals

You can use the Actuals bucket to plot tables for non-comparative measures i.e., when your report does not require the variance between measures. In table mode, the measures added to the Values visual parameter will be assigned to the actuals bucket by default.

#### 2. Comparison fields

You can leverage the comparison buckets to compare the actuals against the previous year's actuals or the plan/forecast. Inforiver will render comparison charts automatically when a measure is assigned to the comparison fields. &#x20;

Letâ€™s explore this by dragging measures to the comparison data wells. The variances are now calculated for the actuals and comparison fields.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Comparison charts will only use the first measure in the Actuals bucket, if there are other measures in the Actuals bucket, they will not be plotted.
{% endhint %}

Variances are automatically calculated in table mode when the second measure is added to the visual. You can display variances from the [Series interface](broken-reference).

#### 3. Enforce IBCS standards

Analytics+ is a **flexbile IBCS** visual. You can easily switch to IBCS mode by enabling the toggle. When IBCS standards are enforced, additional pin charts are rendered for absolute and relative variances. You have the flexibility to remove or retain the pin charts based on your requirements. Additionally, in the pivot data window, the comparison fields are re-named to IBCS notations - AC/PY/PL and FC.&#x20;

#### 4. Split categories into measures

When this property is enabled, each category in the small multiples parameter is split into a separate measure. To see this feature in action, let's change the visual parameters a bit. We'll first add <mark style="color:green;">Quarter</mark> as small multiples parameter and render a trellis.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1455).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Small multiple parameter added</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Split categories into measures option will be displayed only when a small multiple parameter is added to the visual.
{% endhint %}

After enabling the _Split categories into measures_ option, the actuals measure is split into 4 separate measures - 1 for each quarter.

Inforiver supports comparisons for up to 4 measures (AC/PY/PL/FC). If you have added multiple measures or the dimension added to the small multiples parameter has more than 4 categories, only 4 will be rendered. You can configure which categories to plot using the **Values** checkboxes.

#### 5. Lock measures

Inforiver automatically assigns measures to the data wells. You can, however, set up a user-defined data configuration and choose to retain it using the lock option, i.e., if you remove and then add a measure back, it will be assigned to the pre-designated bucket instead of the default bucket. The <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1466).png" alt="" data-size="line">icon changes to <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1467).png" alt="" data-size="line">, indicating that the measure configuration has been locked.

#### 6. Set default bucketing

A measure added to the visual is assigned to the Actuals section by default. You can override this and set a different default bucket.

#### 7. Prompt on data assignment

Enable the _Prompt on data assignment_ checkbox if you want the measure configuration window to open automatically, each time you add a visual measure.

#### 8. Search and select

Analytics+ allows you to add up to 30 measures to your visual. You can select the measures to plot using the checkboxes against each measure. You can easily locate a specific measure using the search bar.
