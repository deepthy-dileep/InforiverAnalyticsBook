# 6. Tables

Inforiver's data table gives you an IBCS-compliant, multi-dimensional, tabular representation of your data in just a few clicks. Similar to the Inforiver Matrix, the data table also offers features like quick number formatting, cell-level annotations, ranking, and conditional formatting to name a few. The Analytics+ data table, however, has a game-changing feature - **small multiple tables**.&#x20;

Small multiple tables are ideal for management reports or dashboards that require a high-level overview of your data. Analytics+ supports synchronized horizontal and vertical scrolling of panels - facilitating comparative analysis between dimensions.

* For advanced use cases such as writeback, planning, what-if simulations, forecasting & budgeting, advanced formulae engine, formatted financial statements, paginated reports, threaded conversations, audit, data editing, scheduling, and notifications - use **Inforiver Matrix**.
* If you want to display tables in compact/IBCS tables with basic conditional formatting, integrated KPI card headers, sorting, Top N, and exports to PDF/Excel -  go for **Analytics+**.
