# Cards trellis layout

The various trellis layouts for cards are intended to guide the viewer through the metrics that you wish to highlight:

* **Grid**: The data is displayed in a row-by-column grid with panels of equal size with uniform scaling.
* **Compact grid:** This layout renders cards in compact stamp-sized panels. Due to efficient real-estate usage on the canvas, this layout is ideal for combining KPI cards with other visuals in a dashboard.
* **Single row:** All the cards will be accommodated in a single row.
* **Single column:** The chart and metrics are displayed side-by-side in this layout. The wide spacing enhances readability and facilitates comparative analysis between metrics. You can position the KPI metrics to the left or right side of the chart.

Interactive resizing is available in the grid and compact grid layouts. You can drag the sides to resize the panels.

In the single-column layout, interactive resizing is available to adjust the card's height.

In the single-row layout, interactive resizing is available to adjust the card's width.
