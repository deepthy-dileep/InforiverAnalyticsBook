# Tables trellis layout

Analytics+ provides different layouts for small multiple tables:

* **Grid**: The data is displayed in a row-by-column grid with panels of equal size with uniform scaling.
* **Scaled table:** The size of each panel is determined by the number of rows and columns in the table.
* **Single row:** All the small multiple tables will be accommodated side-by-side in a single row.
* **Single column:** All the small multiple tables will be rendered one below the other in a single column.

{% hint style="info" %}
Interactive resizing is available in the grid layout. You can drag the sides to resize the panels.
{% endhint %}
