# Splitting and grouping: cards

In this section, we'll discover the various options in Inforiver to split and group measures in Card mode.

### 1. Splitting measures

When you have multiple measures and categories in your chart, you can display each measure in a separate panel. Click on the **Split** button in the toolbar.

In this example, we have added Subcategory as the small multiples parameter. When the split option is enabled, a separate panel is created for each category and each measure.

### 2. Measures category

When the split option is enabled a **measures category** is created: the measures can be rendered as rows/columns/legends.

The image below shows the measures rendered as columns.

You can also render measures as stacked charts by assigning the measures group to the legends bucket.

### 3. Grouping measures

You can combine related measures into a single KPI card. Let's look at the steps involved in creating custom measure groups.

**Step 1:**  Click the Group Measure option, to create measure groups.

**Step 3:** Select related measures to create a group. You can provide a relevant name for the group in the Title textbox. When you click Apply, the selected measures are combined into a single panel.

**Step 4:** Notice that a line chart is rendered for the group. You can customize the chart type for each panel after creating groups. In the example, we've created 2 measure groups for Actuals and Plan and changed the chart type to Column + column.
