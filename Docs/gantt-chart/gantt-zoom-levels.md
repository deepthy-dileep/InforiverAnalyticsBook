# Gantt: Zoom levels

The Analytics+ Gantt supports detailed planning and tracking with the Zoom option. You can even customize the degree of zoom and tailor it to your data. Click the Zoom Levels button on the toolbar and turn on the Enabled toggle to customize the degree of zoom.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to select a Zoom option (button or mouse wheel) in Canvas settings > General tab
{% endhint %}

You can configure up to 5 levels of zoom. Click on the **Add new level** button. For instance, the highest level could be Year/Qtr/Month and the lowest could be Day/Hour/Minute - depnding on the timelines defined in your project. In this example, we have defined 3 levels.&#x20;

* **Date/time format:** Specify the date or time format. For instance, to display the full month name, use "MMMM", for short month use "MMM".&#x20;
* **Interval**: Define the interval between 2 consecutive time periods. For instance, to display every day in the timeline, set the interval to 1, or to display alternate months, set the interval to 2.&#x20;

The image below shows the fully zoomed-out timeline at the highest level - year/quarter/month. The timelines for the entire project are visible in a single screen without having to scroll. We've specified an interval of 2 months in the zoom level settings for the quarters and months, so you'll see that alternate months and quarters are skipped in the timeline.

When we click the zoom-in button, the timeline is expanded to the next defined level - quarter/month/week. The scroll bar is enabled to navigate the timeline. In this case, all the quarters and months are displayed, but we've specified an interval of 2 for the weeks. The month short names are displayed as we've used the 'MMM' format.

The animation shows how the timeline and the Gantt chart changes as we zoom in.
