# Gantt: Conditional formatting

Improve project and resource tracking in Gantt charts with conditional formatting - automatically highlight delayed tasks, draw focus to upcoming deadlines, and quickly identify bottlenecks or missed deadlines.

### 1. Highlighting task and subtask names

Bring attention to specific tasks or subtasks that may be at risk of missing deadlines. Select 'Datagrid' in the **Impact on** dropdown. In this example, we've highlighted the tasks in red where the progress is less than 50% and the actual start date is later than the planned start date.

### 2. Highlighting progress bars

You can draw attention to the progress bars when there is no significant progress, or when there are delays in the planned timeline. Select 'Timeline Bar' in the **Impacts on** dropdown. The images show how the fill, track, and planned progress bars are highlighted in red when the progress is less than 50%.

### 3. Conditional formatting for milestones

Another way to highlight tasks that are on track or not progressing is by using conditional formatting rules on milestones. Select 'Milestone' in the **Impacts on** dropdown. You can set a custom color and shape for the milestone that satisfies the condition. You also need to select the milestone field from the dropdown.

In this demo, we've used green stars to highlight the milestones for the projects that are on track.

### 4. Status flags

Enable status flags to provide stakeholders with a quick visual representation of the overall project health and status of individual tasks without having to analyze the progress/timelines in detail.&#x20;

Select 'Status flag' in the **Impacts on** dropdown. Select the color from the picker and choose an icon. In this example, we've used blue ticks to indicate tasks and subtasks that are close to completion, red warning symbols for blockers, green flags for tasks that are on track, etc.
