# Layers

When your dashboard contains a large number of elements, the Layers feature can be used to group, manage, and arrange elements. Let's take a look!&#x20;

Navigate to the Properties tab > Board > Layers to open the layers pane.

### 1. Hiding elements

Right-click on the element and select Show/Hide from the context menu to hide or display elements. You can also use the<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (192).png" alt="" data-size="original">icon that appears on hovering over an element. Hidden elements will be grayed out in the Layers pane.

### 2. Bringing elements to the front

Notice how the card elements at the top are behind the charts - we need to bring them forward to resize and align them. To send elements to the background or bring elements to the foreground, click on the element and select the **Bring Front** or **Bring Back** options.

### 3. Creating groups

You can club elements together to form a group. Groups come in useful when you need to perform bulk operations like deleting or duplicating elements.  Select the elements in the layer pane and click the **Group** button from the context menu to create a group.

<div><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (195).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Creating a group</p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/2024-11-29_14h48_26.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Group created</p></figcaption></figure></div>

You can rename groups for easy identification. You can also duplicate and delete them from the context menu.

Select the group and choose **UnGroup Selection** from the context menu to ungroup elements.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **Reset** option will remove all configurations and customizations. You will need to choose the element type and re-configure them from scratch.
{% endhint %}

Grouped elements will be treated as a single entity and can be repositioned easily without having to drag and drop each element.&#x20;

One main application of groups is for creating tabbed dashboards using the Navigation feature which we will cover in the next section.

### 4. Moving elements in the list

When you have a dashboard with a large number of elements, you can use the **Bring Foreward** and **Bring Backward** options to move them above or below the next element.
