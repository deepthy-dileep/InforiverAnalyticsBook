**Image scale:** The **Image Scale** property allows you to control how images are resized and displayed within their allocated space. The available options are:

* **Normal:** Displays the image at its original dimensions, maintaining its aspect ratio.
* **Cover:** Scales the image proportionally to cover the entire container, ensuring that there is no empty space.
* **Fill:** Stretches the image to completely fill the container, regardless of its original aspect ratio.
* **None:** Displays the image without scaling or cropping, retaining the original image size within the container.
