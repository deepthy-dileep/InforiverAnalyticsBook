# Using shapes

Shapes enhance dashboards by making them visually appealing and help draw attention to specific metrics. Let's see how to use shapes in your Analytics+ storyboard.

### 1. Circles

You can use circles to emphasize metrics like actuals vs targets, group elements, or to add visual appeal. In this dashboard, we've used circles around the profile images to enhance the aesthetics.

**Circle customizations:**

* **Border**: Set the thickness and color of the border.
* **Fill**: Set the fill/background color for the circle.
* **Shadow**: Apply a shadow by setting the position, spread, color, and blur.

### 2. Rectangles

You can use rectangles to hold textual data, group multiple elements or create symbols (e.g., a cross symbol for healthcare dashboards). In this dashboard, we used rectangles to create a cross symbol and as a background.

**Rectangle customizations:**

* **Border**: Set the thickness and color of the border. You can also set a border to a specific side of the rectangle.
* **Corner**: Specify the corner radius for rounded corners.
* **Fill**: Set the fill/background color for the rectangle.
* **Shadow**: Apply a shadow by setting the position, spread, color, and blur.

### 3. Lines

Use lines to logically group your data or connect related data elements. In this dashboard, we've used lines to demarcate the employee/staff, patient and metric sections.

**Line customizations:**

* **Fill**: Set the fill/background color for the line.
* **Line**: Set the thickness and style(solid/dashed). Use the **Rotate** option to create vertical, horizontal, or slanting lines by adjusting the degree. Set rounded ends for the line with the **Edge Cap** option.&#x20;

### 4. Triangles

Similar to the other shapes we've discussed triangles can also add aesthetic and informational value to dashboards. Notice how we've used a combination of green triangles and red circles to indicate an increase or decrease in numbers.

**Triangle customizations:**

* **Border**: Set the thickness and color of the border.&#x20;
* **Fill**: Set the fill/background color for the triangle.
