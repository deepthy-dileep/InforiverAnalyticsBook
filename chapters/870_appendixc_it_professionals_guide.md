# C.6 IT Professionals Guide

## Overview for IT Professionals

This guide provides essential information for IT professionals responsible for implementing, managing, and supporting Inforiver Analytics+ within their organization's technical infrastructure. As an IT professional, you'll need to understand system requirements, deployment options, security considerations, and integration scenarios to ensure a successful implementation.

## Implementation Planning

### System Requirements Assessment

Before deployment, verify your environment meets the minimum system requirements:

- **Server Requirements**:
  - See [Appendix A.3: System Requirements](../../appendix_a/a.3/System_Requirements.md) for detailed specifications
  - Pay particular attention to memory and processor requirements for your expected user load
  - Evaluate storage needs based on data volume and refresh frequency

- **Client Requirements**:
  - Browser compatibility (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
  - Minimum RAM requirements for client machines
  - Network bandwidth considerations for remote users

- **Network Infrastructure**:
  - Firewall configurations for data source connectivity
  - Bandwidth requirements for expected concurrent users
  - Latency considerations for geographically distributed teams

### Deployment Options

Evaluate deployment options based on your organization's requirements:

#### Power BI Service (Cloud)
- **Advantages**: Minimal infrastructure management, automatic updates, high availability
- **Considerations**: Data residency, network connectivity, subscription costs
- **Recommendation**: Best for organizations prioritizing rapid deployment and minimal infrastructure management

#### Power BI Report Server (On-Premises)
- **Advantages**: Data remains on-premises, works within existing security perimeter, control over update timing
- **Considerations**: Requires server infrastructure, manual updates, additional licensing
- **Recommendation**: Best for organizations with strict data governance requirements or limited cloud capabilities

#### Hybrid Approach
- **Advantages**: Flexibility to keep sensitive data on-premises while leveraging cloud capabilities
- **Considerations**: More complex configuration, requires secure gateway setup
- **Recommendation**: Best for organizations transitioning to cloud or with mixed data governance requirements
