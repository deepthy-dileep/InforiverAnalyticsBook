# 3.5 Pivot Data Interface

The pivot data interface is a cornerstone of Analytics+, providing powerful capabilities for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing hierarchical and multi-dimensional data. Going beyond the basic pivoting functionality available in Power BI, the Analytics+ pivot interface combines the analytical flexibility of Excel-like pivoting with the visual power of interactive business visualizations. This section explores the pivot interface fundamentals, data manipulation capabilities, and advanced techniques that enable sophisticated data analysis.

Analytics+ offers two interfaces for data management: the standard Pivot Data window and the Advanced Pivot interface. Both provide the same core functionality, but the Advanced Pivot offers an enhanced user experience with real-time visualization updates and additional filtering capabilities.

## Pivot Interface Fundamentals

The Analytics+ pivot interface provides a structured yet flexible approach to data organization and analysis.
