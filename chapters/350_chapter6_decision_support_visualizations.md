# 6.5 Decision Support Visualizations

Transforming data into actionable decisions remains a fundamental challenge for organizations despite the proliferation of business intelligence tools. While traditional visualizations excel at presenting data, Analytics+ offers specialized decision support visualizations that go beyond data presentation to actively guide and support the decision-making process, enabling business users to move from insight to action more efficiently and confidently.

## The Business Need for Decision Support

Organizations face several challenges when attempting to translate data insights into effective decisions:

| Challenge | Business Impact | Traditional Approach |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Insight-to-action gap | Valuable insights fail to drive concrete actions | Separate decision process from analytics tools |
| Decision complexity | Multiple factors and trade-offs complicate choices | Create simplified frameworks outside the BI tool |
| Solution exploration | Difficulty visualizing potential options and outcomes | Manual scenario planning in spreadsheets |
| Stakeholder alignment | Lack of shared understanding for decision rationale | Lengthy meetings and presentations to build consensus |
| Decision documentation | Poor record-keeping of decision context and reasoning | Manual documentation in separate systems |
| Impact forecasting | Inability to reliably predict decision outcomes | Develop custom predictive models |

Analytics+ addresses these challenges with purpose-built decision support visualizations and interfaces that guide users through the decision journey from problem framing to outcome evaluation.

## Core Decision Support Visualizations

Analytics+ provides a comprehensive toolkit of visualizations specifically designed for decision support:

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Visualizations

Support complex decisions with multiple criteria and alternatives:

| Visualization | Key Features | Decision Support Application |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Decision Matrix | Interactive evaluation of alternatives against criteria | Product selection, vendor evaluation, strategic option analysis |
| Weighted Criteria Visualizations | Visual representation of criteria importance | Prioritization decisions, resource allocation |
| Trade-off Charts | Display relationships between competing objectives | Cost vs. quality decisions, schedule vs. scope trade-offs |
| Pareto Frontier Visualization | Identify optimal solutions with multiple objectives | Portfolio optimization, efficiency frontier analysis |
| Sensitivity Analysis Heatmaps | Show how criteria weighting affects outcomes | Test robustness of decisions against preference changes |
| Criteria Correlation Maps | Visualize relationships between evaluation criteria | Identify redundant or conflicting decision factors |

The MCDA visualizations allow decision-makers to systematically evaluate alternatives and make transparent, defensible choices:

```
Example Decision Matrix Application:
"A manufacturing company evaluating 5 potential factory 
locations across 12 criteria (labor costs, supply chain 
proximity, tax incentives, etc.) with customized weighting 
based on strategic priorities. The visualization highlights 
the top-performing options and allows interactive adjustment 
of weights to test decision robustness."
```
