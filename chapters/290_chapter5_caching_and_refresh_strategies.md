## Intelligent Refresh Strategies

Analytics+ implements multiple refresh strategies optimized for different business scenarios:

### Time-Based Refresh Patterns

| Refresh Pattern | Implementation | Appropriate Use Case |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Micro-batch refresh | 15-30 second incremental updates | Operational dashboards requiring near-real-time data |
| Scheduled refresh | Configurable intervals (hourly, daily, etc.) | Regular business reporting with predictable update needs |
| Off-peak refresh | Automatic scheduling during low-usage periods | Large models with intensive refresh operations |
| Progressive refresh | Sequential refresh of visual components | Complex dashboards with varying freshness requirements |
| Event-triggered refresh | Data-change detection initiates targeted refresh | Exception monitoring and alert-driven analytics |

### Segment-Level Refresh Optimization

Rather than refreshing entire datasets, Analytics+ can selectively refresh data segments:

```
Refresh Hierarchy:
├── Dashboard
│   ├── Page 1 (Refresh: 15 min)
│   │   ├── Visual 1.1 (Refresh: 5 min)
│   │   └── Visual 1.2 (Refresh: 15 min)
│   ├── Page 2 (Refresh: 60 min)
│   │   ├── Visual 2.1 (Refresh: 60 min)
│   │   └── Visual 2.2 (Refresh: 60 min)
│   └── Page 3 (Refresh: 24 hr)
│       ├── Visual 3.1 (Refresh: 24 hr)
│       └── Visual 3.2 (Refresh: 24 hr)
```

This hierarchical approach enables targeted refresh operations based on data criticality and update frequency requirements.

### Hybrid Refresh Implementations

Analytics+ supports hybrid refresh scenarios that combine different refresh strategies:

- **Core metrics**: High-frequency refresh (e.g., 5-minute intervals)
- **Supporting metrics**: Medium-frequency refresh (e.g., hourly)
- **Reference data**: Low-frequency refresh (e.g., daily/weekly)
- **Historical comparisons**: Scheduled refresh (e.g., month-end)

This approach allows organizations to prioritize refresh resources for business-critical data while optimizing overall system performance.

## Refresh Transparency and User Experience

Analytics+ implements several user experience features to manage the impact of refresh operations:

### User-Transparent Refresh
