# E.3 Visualization Terminology

## A

**Area Chart**: A chart type that displays quantitative data using a filled area beneath a line connecting data points.

**Annotation**: Text, shapes, or other elements added to a visualization to provide context, explanations, or highlight insights.

**Axis**: A reference line in a chart that defines the scale of measurement for the data being displayed.

## B

**Bar Chart**: A chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents.

**Box Plot**: A visualization method that displays the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

**Bubble Chart**: A variation of a scatter plot where data points are displayed as bubbles, with the size of the bubble representing a third data dimension.

## C

**Candlestick Chart**: A financial chart showing open, high, low, and close prices for a specified time period, commonly used for stock market data.

**Choropleth Map**: A map in which areas are shaded or patterned according to the value of a variable being displayed.

**Color Encoding**: Using different colors to represent different values or categories in a visualization.

**Combination Chart**: A visualization that combines multiple chart types (such as bars and lines) in a single view.

**Connected Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot with points connected by lines, typically to show the evolution of values over time.

**Contour Plot**: A visualization that shows isolines (lines of equal value) to represent three-dimensional data on a two-dimensional surface.

## D

**Dashboard**: An arrangement of multiple visualizations on a single screen, providing a comprehensive view of data and metrics.

**Data-Ink Ratio**: A concept introduced by Edward Tufte that refers to the proportion of a visualization's ink (or pixels) that directly represents data.

**Data Point**: An individual value or element represented in a visualization.

**Dendrogram**: A tree diagram used to illustrate the arrangement of clusters produced by hierarchical clustering.

**Density Plot**: A visualization that shows the distribution of a numeric variable, similar to a histogram but with a smooth curve.

**Donut Chart**: A variation of a pie chart with a hole in the center, sometimes used to improve readability or add additional information in the center.

## F

**Funnel Chart**: A visualization showing values through progressively decreasing stages, typically used for sales processes or conversion rates.

## G

**Gantt Chart**: A bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, showing the start and finish dates of elements such as tasks or events.

**Gauge Chart**: A visualization that displays a single value within a defined range, often using a dial or semicircular display.

**Geo Map**: A visualization that displays data in relation to geographic locations.

**Graph (Network Diagram)**: A visualization of a network, consisting of nodes (entities) and edges (connections between entities).

## H

**Heat Map**: A visualization that uses color intensity to represent data values in a two-dimensional matrix.

**Histogram**: A graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data where data is grouped into bins and displayed as bars.

## I

**IBCS (International Business Communication Standards)**: A set of rules and recommendations for the design of business reports and presentations.

**Icon Array**: A visualization where icons or symbols represent quantities, often used to make proportions more understandable.

**Infographic**: A visual representation of information or data designed to make complex information quickly and easily understandable.

## K

**KPI Visualization**: A display specifically designed to track key performance indicators, often using gauges, bullet charts, or scorecards.

## L

**Line Chart**: A type of chart that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments.

**Lollipop Chart**: A visualization that combines elements of a bar chart and a dot plot, using lines with circles at the end.

## M

**Marimekko Chart**: A visualization that shows categorical data with variable-width columns and rows, allowing for comparison across two variables.

**Multi-Series Chart**: A chart that displays multiple data series (groups of related data points) in the same visualization.

## P

**Parallel Coordinates Plot**: A visualization for multivariate data that plots each observation as a line across parallel axes.

**Pie Chart**: A circular chart divided into sectors, each representing a proportion of the whole.

**Polar Chart**: A circular visualization where values are plotted along radial axes extending from a central point.

**Population Pyramid**: A back-to-back histogram showing the distribution of age and sex in a population.

## Q

**Quadrant Chart**: A scatter plot divided into four sections (quadrants) to categorize data points.

## R

**Radar Chart (Spider Chart)**: A two-dimensional chart that displays multivariate data as a polygon with values plotted on axes starting from the same point.

**Reference Line**: A line added to a visualization to provide context, such as an average, target, or threshold value.

**Regression Line**: A line on a scatter plot that represents the best fit through the data points, showing the relationship between variables.

**Rose Chart (Polar Area Diagram)**: A circular visualization where segments have equal angles but varying radii.

## S

**Sankey Diagram**: A flow diagram where the width of arrows or streams is proportional to the flow quantity.

**Scatter Plot**: A chart that uses Cartesian coordinates to display values for two variables as points.

**Small Multiples**: Multiple small charts of the same type showing different facets of data, enabling comparison.

**Sparkline**: A small, word-sized chart that shows trends or variations in data, typically without axes or coordinates.

**Stream Graph**: A variation of a stacked area chart, where areas are displaced around a central axis, resulting in a flowing, organic shape.

**Sunburst Chart**: A hierarchical visualization similar to a multi-level pie chart, showing relationships between a root node and its descendants.

## T

**Tableau**: A popular data visualization software platform.

**Treemap**: A visualization that displays hierarchical data using nested rectangles, where the area of each rectangle is proportional to its value.

**Trellis Display (Small Multiples)**: A series of similar graphs or charts arranged in a grid, each showing a different subset of the data.

## V

**Violin Plot**: A combination of a box plot and a density plot that shows the distribution of data and its probability density.

**Visualization Hierarchy**: The organization of visual elements in terms of their importance and visibility in a design.

## W

**Waterfall Chart**: A visualization that shows how an initial value is affected by positive and negative changes, resulting in a final value.

**Word Cloud**: A visual representation of text data where the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.
