# E.5 Analytics and Reporting Concepts

## A

**Actionable Insights**: Information derived from data analysis that can be directly used to make decisions or take specific actions.

**Ad Hoc Analysis**: Specialized, one-time analysis to answer a specific business question, typically conducted as needed rather than on a regular schedule.

**Advanced Analytics**: Techniques that go beyond traditional business intelligence to predict future trends, find patterns, or provide deeper insights.

**Anomaly Detection**: The process of identifying data points, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the dataset's normal behavior.

## B

**Benchmarking**: Comparing performance metrics to industry standards or best practices to assess performance gaps.

**Bottom-Up Analysis**: An analytical approach that starts with granular details and aggregates upward to form conclusions.

**Burst Reporting**: The scheduled, automated distribution of reports to a large number of recipients at one time.

**Business Metrics**: Quantifiable measures used to track business performance against organizational goals.

## C

**Cascading Reports**: A set of related reports where the parameters of one report determine the content of subsequent reports.

**Cohort Analysis**: A subset of behavioral analytics that takes data from a dataset and groups it by related characteristics.

**Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating data by comparing two or more variables to find relationships, differences, or similarities.

**Correlation Analysis**: Statistical method used to evaluate the strength of relationship between two variables.

**Cross-Tabulation**: A statistical method that displays the frequency distribution of variables in a matrix format.

## D

**Data Democratization**: Making digital information accessible to the average non-technical user, without requiring specialized training.

**Data Governance**: The overall management of data availability, usability, integrity, and security in an enterprise.

**Data Storytelling**: Communicating insights using narrative elements and visualizations to make complex data more understandable.

**Decision Support System (DSS)**: Information systems that assist in organizational decision-making activities.

**Descriptive Analytics**: Analysis that describes what has happened in the past.

**Diagnostic Analytics**: Analysis focused on understanding why something happened.

**Drill-Down Analysis**: The process of moving from summary information to detailed data.

## E

**Embeddable Analytics**: The integration of analytical capabilities directly into business applications, workflows, or portals.

**Exception Reporting**: Reporting that focuses only on data that falls outside of predetermined thresholds.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: An approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.

## F

**Financial Analytics**: Analysis focused specifically on an organization's financial data to track performance and guide planning.

**Forecasting**: Using historical data to predict future outcomes.

## G

**Gap Analysis**: The process of comparing actual performance with potential or desired performance.

**Geospatial Analysis**: Analysis that incorporates geographical data to solve problems or visualize patterns.

## H

**Hypothesis Testing**: A statistical method that tests assumptions about a population parameter.

## I

**Inferential Statistics**: Drawing conclusions about a population based on analysis of a sample.

**Insight Generation**: The process of extracting meaningful information from data that can be used for business decisions.

## K

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**: A measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives.

## L

**Lead Indicator**: A measurable factor that changes before the overall economy or business trend begins to follow a particular pattern.

**Lag Indicator**: A measurable factor that changes only after the economy or business trend has already begun to follow a particular pattern.

## M

**Market Basket Analysis**: A data mining technique that discovers relationships between products purchased together.

**Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Analysis that examines data across multiple dimensions or categories simultaneously.

## N

**Narrative Reporting**: Reports that combine data with textual explanations and context.

**Normalization**: The process of reorganizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## O

**Operational Analytics**: Analysis of data generated from business operations to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

**Operational Reporting**: Reports that focus on day-to-day business activities and short-term decision making.

**Outlier Analysis**: The process of examining data points that differ significantly from the majority of the data.

## P

**Pareto Analysis**: A technique based on the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to identify the factors that have the most significant impact.

**Pathway Analysis**: Analyzing the sequence of actions or events to understand how users navigate through a system.

**Prescriptive Analytics**: Advanced analytics that recommends actions to take based on data analysis.

**Predictive Analytics**: Using statistical algorithms and machine learning to identify the likelihood of future outcomes.

## Q

**Quantitative Analysis**: The use of mathematical and statistical methods to evaluate investments and make business decisions.

**Qualitative Analysis**: Research that seeks to understand behaviors or experiences through non-numerical data.

## R

**Real-Time Analytics**: The analysis of data as soon as it becomes available, enabling immediate response.

**Regression Analysis**: A statistical method for estimating relationships among variables.

**Report Automation**: The process of generating reports automatically according to a schedule or trigger.

**Report Distribution**: The methods and processes used to deliver reports to intended audiences.

**Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis**: Assessment of the efficiency or profitability of an investment.

**Rolling Forecast**: A forecasting method that continuously updates predictions based on the most recent data.

## S

**Scenario Analysis**: The process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes.

**Segmentation Analysis**: Dividing a broad population into sub-groups based on shared characteristics.

**Self-Service Analytics**: Tools that enable business users to filter, analyze, and visualize data without requiring technical expertise.

**Sentiment Analysis**: Using natural language processing to identify and extract subjective information from source materials.

**Statistical Analysis**: The collection, examination, summarization, manipulation, and interpretation of quantitative data.

**Strategic Reporting**: Reports designed to support long-term planning and strategic decision-making.

## T

**Tactical Reporting**: Reports focused on medium-term planning and operational effectiveness.

**Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals.

**Top-Down Analysis**: An approach that starts with an overall picture and breaks it down into component parts.

**Trend Analysis**: A technique for identifying patterns or trends in data over time.

## V

**Variance Analysis**: Comparing actual performance against planned or expected performance to identify deviations.

**Visualization Best Practices**: Guidelines for creating effective data visualizations that accurately represent data and facilitate understanding.

## W

**What-If Analysis**: A process of changing values in cells to see how those changes affect the outcome of formulas in a model.

**Writeback**: The capability to input data back to the source system, enabling planning and forecasting scenarios.
