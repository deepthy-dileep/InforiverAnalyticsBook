# 4.4 Interactive What-If Analysis

What-if analysis is a powerful decision-making technique that allows business users to model hypothetical scenarios and immediately see their potential impacts. While traditional Power BI implements what-if parameters at the data model level requiring DAX knowledge, Analytics+ enhances these capabilities by providing better integration and visualization options for what-if scenarios.

> **Note:** The documentation indicates that advanced what-if simulations, scenario planning, and writeback capabilities are primarily available in Inforiver Matrix rather than Analytics+. As stated in the documentation: "For advanced use cases such as writeback, planning, what-if simulations, forecasting & budgeting, advanced formulae engine, formatted financial statements, paginated reports, threaded conversations, audit, data editing, scheduling, and notifications - use **Inforiver Matrix**."
>
> This chapter focuses on the what-if capabilities that are available in Analytics+ through integration with Power BI parameters and other features.

## The Business Value of What-If Analysis

Before diving into implementation details, it's important to understand why what-if analysis is critical for modern business intelligence:

- **Proactive decision-making**: Evaluate potential outcomes before committing resources
- **Risk assessment**: Identify vulnerabilities by testing extreme scenarios
- **Sensitivity testing**: Determine which variables have the greatest impact on outcomes
- **Budget planning**: Model different allocation strategies to optimize results
- **Target setting**: Work backward from desired outcomes to determine required inputs
- **Strategic planning**: Test assumptions underlying long-term business strategies

Analytics+ makes these capabilities accessible to business users without technical expertise, democratizing advanced analytical techniques across the organization.

## Implementing What-If Analysis with Analytics+

Based on the documentation, here's how to implement what-if analysis using Analytics+ with Power BI parameters:

### Creating Dynamic Rankings with Parameters

As documented in the "Dynamic ranking with numeric parameters" section, you can set up dynamic ranking in 2 simple steps:

1. **Create a Power BI Parameter**:
   - In Power BI Desktop, go to Modeling tab â†’ What-if parameter
   - Create a numeric parameter (e.g., "RankingSlider")
   - Set minimum, maximum, and increment values
   - Choose slider as the display type

2. **Configure Analytics+ to Use the Parameter**:
   - **STEP 1:** Assign the Power BI numeric range parameter to the Tooltip categories visual parameter
   - **STEP 2:** In the TopN configuration window, select "Measure" from the "By" dropdown
   - Select the numeric range parameter name from the "Measure" dropdown

3. **Interact with the Parameter**:
   - Adjust the parameter slider to dynamically change the ranking
   - Observe how the visualization updates in real-time
   - Use the parameter to answer "what-if" questions about ranking thresholds

### Implementing Context-Aware Analysis

The documentation describes how to create context-aware visualizations that respond to parameter changes:

1. **Create a Filter-Context Measure**:
   - Let Analytics+ automatically generate the DAX script for you
   - The documentation notes: "The steps to configure filter context are the same for charts, cards and tables"

2. **Apply Context Awareness to Visualizations**:
   - Add annotations that will update based on filter context
   - Create conditional formatting rules that respond to context changes
   - Configure visualizations to adapt to different parameter scenarios

3. **Test Context Awareness**:
   - Change parameter values to see how annotations and formatting update
   - Apply filters to observe how the visualization responds to context changes
   - Use slicers to dynamically alter the visualization context

### Using Comparative Analysis for Scenarios

Analytics+ provides robust comparative analysis capabilities that can be used for scenario comparison:

1. **Create Base View**: Set up your initial visualization with default parameter values

2. **Create Comparison Views**:
   - Use small multiples to show different parameter scenarios side by side
   - Apply variance calculations to highlight differences between scenarios
   - Use conditional formatting to emphasize significant differences

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Compare outcomes across different parameter settings
   - Identify optimal parameter values for specific business objectives
   - Document insights from the comparative analysis

## Real-World Example: Dynamic Ranking Analysis

Based on the documentation, here's a practical example of using Analytics+ for what-if analysis with dynamic ranking:
